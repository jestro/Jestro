### About Me
Hi, I am Jestro, an undergraduate student from Belgium currently pursuing a bachelor degree in Cyber Security from Howest. I did 3 semesters in Applied Computer Science, although I enjoyed developing I am more interested in security.

Outside of my studies, Iâ€™m passionate about staying active. Whether it's working out at the gym or exploring the outdoors on hikes and walks. In my downtime, I immerse myself in video games and philosophical ideas.
